#Virtual Call Center Floor

Co-Lead a team of five to create a web application for a client to observe the state of thousands of employees.
Each employee is represented as a colored dot. The color represents the state each employee is in.
The overall coloring of the screen and real-time color change patterns enable the client to derive what the employees are doing.

Uses HTML/CSS and JavaScript for frontend to create a login system for the supervisor when he can get in to access the data.

The data is pulled via REST API.
Use Node.js and Express.js for the backend in order to pull data and store it in MYSQL database.

The data is fetched from the database and displayed as colored dots on the front end.
